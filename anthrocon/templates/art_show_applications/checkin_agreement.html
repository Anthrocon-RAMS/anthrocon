<p>I understand that I am giving Anthrocon the right to sell my art at the above prices. I also understand that I will be charged a commission of 15% on all sales (12.5% if I paid for space in the Dealers Room) and that the convention will collect sales tax on my sales. I also have read and agree to the Art Show rules.</p>
<p>Anthrocon reserves the right to remove works for sale that, in our sole discretion, do not conform to our rules and policies. Anthrocon will have no liability for any loss, including but not limited to lost revenue, resulting from the removal of works from the Anthrocon Art Show for violation of its rules and/or policies.</p>
<p>If I have chosen an agent I understand that they have the rights to act as myself and make decisions on my behalf.</p>
<p>I understand that all unsold art must be picked up between 2PM and 5PM on Sunday.</p>
