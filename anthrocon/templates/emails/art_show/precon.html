necessary, especially if you think you might not need all the space you've reserved. Of course, you're entitled to use it all if you need it, since you asked for it first, but there are a number of artists on the waiting list hoping to get any space that can be freed up. Simply reply to this email.

Before the con, please enter the bid sheet information for your pieces on <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/art_show_applications/edit?id={{ app.id }}" target="_blank">your personalized reservation page here</a>. We recommend bookmarking this page or saving this email in case you need to add or change pieces later.

We have a crew of dedicated volunteers who are eager to put on a good Art Show, but we can always use more help. If you've already agreed to volunteer, thank you! Otherwise, if you can spare an hour or two at the con, please volunteer. If you work 18 hours or more, we will give you a free membership for next year. To sign up, <a href="https://reg.anthrocon.org/apply/volunteer" target="_blank">login to your {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} registration account</a> and fill out the volunteer form.
</p><p>
Don't forget, we will award ribbons for the best works as judged by Anthrocon's chairman and staff and the Art Show Director, as well as selected by popular vote. And, among the many events at the con, the Art Show will be hosting a festive Artists and Dealers Reception on Friday night, July 4. This is your chance to meet and socialize with fellow artists, and invited dealers, ultrasponsors, supersponsors, and staff. Feel free to "dress up" if you can, or even wear a mask or costume! When you check in at the Art Show, you will receive an invitation to the reception, so I hope to see you there.
